This program is merely a practice in coding study and is intended to be shared with other classmates. 
I have not packaged this program because its functions are very easy. It is still under development. 
The program's operation relies on the libraries Pygame and Matplotlib. Pygame is used for visualization, while Matplotlib serves as an analysis tool.
